##To use:
1. As the software is not hosted on a website, any device running this software must download the repo to their computer.
2. Depending on whether the device is intended for a student or administrator, go into the relevant folder (`student-ui` for students v.s. `ta-ui` for instructors) and open `index.html`.
3. Have fun!
